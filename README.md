# Studio Shodwe

Aims for this project are to create a visually appealing e-commerce site, minimal layout but with some nice UI tricks to keep it interesting.

## API
The fakeStore API is pretty limited, could not find a better alternative and could be nice just to create my own on Postman to pad out the categories a bit more.

Currently just iterating over available 20 returned to create the header categories

## React
See the need from the last few projects to get a handle on useReducer to limit my API calls and spread global state without causing rerenders anytime someone so much as glances at an icon.

## E-commerce
Will have a look at stripe API and try to integrate it into the site, if not I would atleast like to add firebase so the cart retains information and I can see if anyone has utilised the site.
